# Third-Party Notices

This project incorporates or derives from third-party material. Each item below
lists what was used and the license it was used under.

## YAM-UMI — original gripper design

tinyumi is a derivative of [YosubShin/yam-umi](https://github.com/YosubShin/yam-umi),
based on commit `2862fe2`. The original MIT license and Yosub Shin copyright
notice are retained in [LICENSE](LICENSE). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
for this fork’s additions. Historical design notes and measurements are
preserved in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## I2RT — reference meshes and prototype fingertips

`hardware/reference/i2rt_linear_4310/` includes pinned upstream tip meshes,
model XML and MIT license. [source.json](hardware/reference/i2rt_linear_4310/source.json)
records the source commit, paths and hashes. The print prototypes in
`bambu/full_rebuild/tip_*_prototype.stl` trim those meshes to remove the stock
rack; assembly illustrations also derive from these meshes. This is an
additional use beyond the original camera interface described below.

## HandUMI — optional controller supports

`pos-tracking/quest_mount/handumi_v1/` contains original and modified controller
support CAD from [murobotics-ai/handumi-hw](https://github.com/murobotics-ai/handumi-hw),
commit `fc7462ad1ed58c0c8538f6c7dbb732211d088ca8`, under Apache-2.0.
The upstream licence is included in that folder's `source/LICENSE`.
The modified supports retain the controller rings and replace the mounting ends
to attach to tinyumi. See the folder README for source paths and modification
details. These optional supports are an exception to the original-work statement
about `pos-tracking/` below.

## I2RT Robotics — YAM robot models and CAD

This design is dimensioned from three sets of files published by I2RT Robotics
for YAM owners:

- the **YAM URDFs**,
- the **camera mount CAD** for the linear-gear gripper, and
- the **gripper cable retainer**.

Together these are what make the gripper geometry and the wrist camera pose match
the deployed robot.

**Scope of what is derived.** I2RT's plate CAD is supplied as a single merged
mesh, so it provides overall form but no separable components. In the original YAM-UMI release, the gripper mechanism was drawn
from scratch — `plate_v6`, `adapter_v10`, `L_bracket_v3`, `handle_v13`, the pinion
variants, and all of `pos-tracking/` are original work, dimensioned either
independently or by measuring the physical robot. The derived content is the
mounting geometry needed to make the camera pose and jaw interface match, not the
mechanism.

**Source.** These were taken from the CAD folder I2RT distributes to customers,
linked from the [YAM product page](https://i2rt.com/products/yam-6-dof-arm) and
hosted on
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17en5gl898ILuapsgUwBkjy4y5SOWQhB2).
That folder carries no stated licence or terms of use.

**Licence status.** I2RT publishes the same designs, in mesh form, in their
open-source [`i2rt-robotics/i2rt`](https://github.com/i2rt-robotics/i2rt)
repository under the MIT Licence — including
`i2rt/robot_models/arm/yam/v1/` (URDFs and meshes),
`i2rt/robot_models/gripper/linear_4310/assets/d405/camera_bracket_for_D405_linear_4310_.stl`
and `.../Cable_holder.stl`. That MIT grant covers the files in that repository. It
is strong evidence that I2RT intends these designs to be openly used, but it is
not itself a licence for the separately distributed CAD folder, which is where the
geometry used here came from.

## HandUMI (Murobotics)

The original YAM-UMI gripper mechanism did not use HandUMI CAD. The optional
controller supports added in this fork do, as documented above. HandUMI was
the direct starting point for the original work
and is credited as prior art. The design ideas adopted here are the hand-worn,
glove-style form factor, retaining the operator's fingers with hook-and-loop
straps, and keeping the two jaws mechanically synchronized — implemented
independently with a rack-and-pinion on linear rails rather than HandUMI's crank
linkage. HandUMI is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

## Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI)

No CAD from UMI is used here. UMI (Chi et al.) is the origin of the overall
approach, including fiducial-based gripper-aperture sensing, which this design
returns to. See <https://umi-gripper.github.io/>.
